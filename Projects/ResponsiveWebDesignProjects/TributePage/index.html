            <hr>
            <ui id="quotes">
                <li>Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.</li>
                <li>Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful that’s what matters to me.</li>
                <li>Creativity is just connecting things.</li>
                <li>Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</li>
                <li>You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.</li>
                <li>Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.</li>
                <li>Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.</li>
                <li>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.</li>
                <li>Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.</li>
                <li>Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. 
                    You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</li>
                <li>You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you’re not passionate enough from the start, you’ll never stick it out.</li>
                <li>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</li>
                <li>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world.
                    Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. 
                    Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. 
                    And you can change it, you can influence it. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.
