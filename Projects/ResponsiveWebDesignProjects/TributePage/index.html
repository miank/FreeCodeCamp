            <ui id="quotes">
                <li>Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.</li>
                <li>Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful that’s what matters to me.</li>
                <li>Creativity is just connecting things.</li>
                <li>Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</li>
                <li>You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.</li>
                <li>Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.</li>
                <li>Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.</li>
                <li>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.</li>
                <li>Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.</li>
                <li>Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. 
                    You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</li>
                <li>You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you’re not passionate enough from the start, you’ll never stick it out.</li>
